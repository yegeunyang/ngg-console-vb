# Number Guessing Game (Console VB.NET)

A simple command-line number guessing game written in **VB.NET**.  
Created for learning purposes.

## ðŸŽ® How It Works
- The program takes two arguments: a **lower bound** and an **upper bound**.
- It picks a random number in that range.
- You guess until you find the right number, or type `quit` to exit.
- It tells you if your guess is too high or too low.
